# Getting the bigger picture
Elastic (ELK) stack, Beats & Ansible automation

## What we are trying to achieve
- ELK stack deployment, clustering and configuration done consistently
- Elastic Beats family automation and deployment
- Combine Elastic Beats modules to create single deployment package
- Consistent automation using Ansible rather than adhoc scripts
- Configurations done centrally and templated using Ansible
